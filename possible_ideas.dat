For this TIL the goal is to reach 100 articles by the end of 2024. The articles should be generated everyday otherwise it defeats the purpose of 'TIL'.

Articles which are on high priority in my list:


1. The Neutron star mass limit.
2. The movement of plasma in the Sun Earth region.
3. The transmission of any wavelength light through the atmosphere.
5. Early galaxies.
6. Polarization of light (astrophysical 1,2,3 maybe a sequence!)
9. Synchrotron self absorption.
10. Malmquist vs the Eddington Bias.
11. Fermi acceleration in astrophysics.
12. Superluminal Motion in quasars.
13. The cosmological constant.
15. The stellar population synthesis modeling.
16. Inhomogeneity in quasar accretion disks.
17. The sizes of AGN accretion disks (Microlensing+ Reverberation Mapping)
18. Giant Radio galaxies.
19. Polarization in AGN.
20. The Lyman and Balmer breaks observed in the spectra.
