<h2> A collection of review papers on AGN</h2>
    
<p>Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are among the most luminous and dynamic phenomena in the universe, powered by accretion of matter onto supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies. Over the past few decades, the study of AGN has blossomed into a rich field, encompassing everything from relativistic jets and accretion physics to galaxy evolution and cosmology. For both newcomers and seasoned researchers, review papers offer a valuable gateway into this expansive domainâ€”consolidating decades of observations, theory, and simulation into accessible narratives.</p>

<p>This curated collection of AGN review papers aims to serve as a reliable starting point and reference shelf for anyone interested in exploring the field in depth. It includes seminal overviews, thematic reviews (e.g. obscuration, variability, AGN-galaxy co-evolution), and recent syntheses that reflect the current frontiers shaped by multi-wavelength and time-domain surveys. Whether you're brushing up on the basics or diving into a specific subfield, this set of reviews provides an essential guide to understanding the complex and evolving picture of AGN.</p>
