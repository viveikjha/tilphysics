Introduction</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1977MNRAS.179..433B/abstract"target=None>Blandford-Znajek (BZ) mechanism </a>, proposed by Roger Blandford and Roman Znajek in 1977, is a cornerstone in theoretical astrophysics, offering a framework to explain the formation and energy extraction of relativistic jets from rotating black holes. Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are among the most energetic phenomena in the universe, and the BZ mechanism provides a model for how rotational energy from a black hole can be converted into the powerful, highly collimated jets observed in many AGN systems.</p>

<h3>2. Theoretical Foundation</h3>


<p>The BZ mechanism is intimately connected to the physics of rotating black holes described by the Kerr metric, which governs the spacetime geometry around a spinning black hole. The Kerr metric accounts for the frame-dragging effect, a key ingredient for the BZ process. In this setup, the rotating spacetime combined with the magnetic field leads to electromagnetic induction, which is central to the BZ mechanism.

In addition to the Kerr geometry, the behavior of electromagnetic fields in the vicinity of the rotating black hole plays a crucial role. Maxwell’s equations in curved spacetime govern how magnetic fields and currents evolve near the black hole, forming the basis for energy extraction.</p>

<h3>The Blandford-Znajek Process</h3>

<p>Blandford-Znajek (BZ) mechanism relies on three key components: a rotating black hole, a magnetized accretion disk, and a magnetic field threading the event horizon. Together, these elements enable the extraction of energy from the black hole and the formation of relativistic jets.</p> 

<h4>Rotating Black Hole and Frame-Dragging</h4>
<p>The first crucial element is the rotating black hole, described by the Kerr metric. The black hole's rotation causes a phenomenon known as frame-dragging, where spacetime near the black hole is "twisted" in the direction of the rotation. This effect plays a pivotal role in the BZ mechanism because it allows the black hole's rotational energy to be tapped into.

As the black hole spins, the frame-dragging effect influences the behavior of nearby particles and magnetic fields, which are dragged along with the rotation. This effect, combined with a magnetic field near the event horizon, is essential for generating the electric fields needed to accelerate charged particles and power the jets.</p>

<h4>Magnetized Accretion Disk</h4>
<p>The accretion disk is a structure of gas and plasma that spirals inward toward the black hole. As the material in the disk moves closer to the black hole, it becomes highly magnetized due to the complex interaction between the plasma and magnetic fields. The accretion disk provides the fuel for the system and plays a vital role in shaping the magnetic field that threads the black hole’s event horizon.

The disk's plasma is a key source of charged particles, which interact with the magnetic fields in the vicinity of the black hole. As material accretes onto the black hole, it enhances the magnetic field strength, and this magnetic field, in turn, connects to the black hole’s horizon, facilitating energy extraction via the BZ mechanism. The accretion process also helps establish the collimated structure of the jets that emerge from the system.</p>

<h4>Magnetic Field and Electromagnetic Induction</h4>
<p>A large-scale magnetic field threading the black hole's event horizon is the third critical component. The origin of this magnetic field is likely tied to the accretion disk, which generates and amplifies magnetic fields through magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) processes.

The frame-dragging effect of the rotating black hole twists these magnetic field lines, inducing an electric field near the event horizon. This electromagnetic induction is essential for the BZ process. The induced electric field accelerates charged particles along the magnetic field lines, creating relativistic jets. These jets are highly collimated and travel along the black hole’s rotation axis.

The energy extraction from the black hole's rotation powers these jets, and the efficiency of this process increases with both the black hole's spin and the strength of the magnetic field threading the horizon. </p>


<h3>4. Numerical Simulations and Recent Developments</h3>

<p>In recent years, general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations have provided new insights into the BZ mechanism. These simulations reveal a spine-sheath structure in BZ-driven jets, where a fast, highly relativistic core (spine) is surrounded by a slower-moving outer layer (sheath). The inner region of the jet is powered directly by the BZ mechanism, while the outer regions may be influenced by the surrounding accretion flow.

The structure and power of the jet depend heavily on the configuration of the magnetic field. A split-monopole magnetic field configuration, where the magnetic field lines emanate symmetrically from the black hole, is particularly efficient for energy extraction. For black holes with high spins, jet power scales steeply with spin, showing a near-quadratic dependence for moderate spins, but rising rapidly for higher values.</p>

<h3> 5. Observational Evidence</h3>

<p>A number of observational signatures provide strong support for the BZ mechanism as a source of AGN jet power. For instance, observations show a strong correlation between jet power and black hole spin in AGN, consistent with the BZ model’s predictions. Furthermore, the detection of very high Lorentz factors in AGN jets aligns with the relativistic velocities expected from BZ-driven outflows.

Additionally, Faraday rotation measurements of AGN jets, which probe the alignment of magnetic fields, suggest the presence of strong, ordered magnetic fields threading the jets—another prediction of the BZ mechanism. Perhaps most compelling is the recent Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) imaging of the M87 galaxy's jet base, which reveals a morphology and structure that strongly support a BZ-type origin for the jet.</p>

<h3>6. Challenges and Open Questions</h3>

Despite its successes, several challenges and unanswered questions remain in fully understanding the BZ mechanism:

<ul>
<li>Magnetic Field Origin: While the BZ mechanism requires strong, ordered magnetic fields, the exact processes responsible for generating and sustaining these fields in AGN are not fully understood.</li>
  
<li>Jet Composition: The composition of AGN jets, whether primarily leptonic (electron-positron pairs) or hadronic (protons and heavier ions), remains an area of active debate. The BZ mechanism can, in principle, work with either, but detailed understanding is needed.</li>


<li>Jet Stability: Jets remain collimated over vast distances (up to millions of light-years). The mechanisms that ensure their stability over such distances, and their interaction with surrounding environments, are still not completely clear.</li>

<li>Accretion Dynamics: The interplay between the BZ mechanism and accretion flows remains a complex problem. Accretion flows can influence the magnetic field structure and jet dynamics, complicating the theoretical picture.</li>

            <h2>1. Introduction: Cosmic Ionization History</h2>
            <p>The reionization epoch marks a fundamental transition in the universe's evolution, characterized by the transformation of the intergalactic medium (IGM) from a neutral to an ionized state. This process occurred in two distinct phases: hydrogen reionization and helium reionization, each driven by different astrophysical phenomena and having profound implications for structure formation and observational cosmology.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="recombination">
            <h2>2. Recombination and the Dark Ages</h2>
            <p>Following the Big Bang, the universe existed in a hot, dense, and ionized state. At redshift z ≈ 1100 (approximately 380,000 years after the Big Bang), as the universe expanded and cooled to T ≈ 3000 K, protons and electrons recombined to form neutral hydrogen. This process, described by the Saha equation, marked the beginning of the "Dark Ages." During this period, the universe was dominated by neutral hydrogen, making it opaque to ultraviolet radiation.</p>

        <section id="hydrogen-reionization">
            <h2>3. Hydrogen Reionization: The Cosmic Dawn</h2>
            
            <h3>3.1 Population III Stars and Early Galaxies</h3>
            <p>The reionization of hydrogen began with the formation of Population III stars around z ≈ 20-30. These metal-free stars, with masses potentially reaching 100-1000 M☉ and effective temperatures of T_eff ≈ 10^5 K, produced a hard UV spectrum capable of ionizing hydrogen efficiently. The ionizing photon production rate of these early sources is crucial for understanding the progress of reionization.</p>

            <h3>3.2 Stromgren Spheres and Bubble Growth</h3>
            <p>The growth of ionized regions around these first sources can be conceptualized using the Stromgren sphere formalism. Initially, these ionized bubbles are confined by the balance between ionization and recombination rates. As sources become more numerous and bubbles begin to overlap, the reionization process accelerates, leading to a percolation phase where most of the IGM becomes ionized.</p>

            <h3>3.3 Inhomogeneous Reionization and the Cosmic Web</h3>
            <p>The reionization process was highly inhomogeneous, influenced by the underlying density field of the cosmic web. Overdense regions, which hosted the first sources, ionized first, while underdense voids remained neutral for longer periods. This inhomogeneity has significant implications for the observational signatures of reionization.</p>

            <h3>3.4 Completion of Hydrogen Reionization</h3>
            <p>Observations indicate that hydrogen reionization was largely complete by redshift z ≈ 6, approximately 1 billion years after the Big Bang. This conclusion is primarily based on the Gunn-Peterson trough observed in high-redshift quasar spectra. The absence of Gunn-Peterson absorption at z &lt; 6 suggests that the IGM was highly ionized by this time, with neutral fractions below ~10^-4.</p>

        <section id="helium-reionization">
            <h2>4. Helium Reionization: The Role of Quasars</h2>
            <p>While hydrogen and HeI were ionized by the first stars and galaxies, the complete ionization of HeII required more energetic photons, primarily provided by quasars. The HeII reionization epoch, occurring at lower redshifts (z ≈ 3-4), had significant impacts on the thermal history of the IGM.</p>

            <h3>4.1 Quasar Emission Spectra and HeII Ionization</h3>
            <p>Quasars, powered by accreting supermassive black holes, emit a power-law spectrum typically modeled with a spectral index α ≈ 1.5 - 2 for the extreme UV and soft X-ray regime relevant for HeII ionization. The HeII ionization cross-section peaks at 54.4 eV and decreases as ν^(-3) at higher energies, making quasars with harder spectra more efficient at ionizing HeII.</p>

            <h3>4.2 IGM Heating During Helium Reionization</h3>
            <p>The photoionization of HeII deposited significant energy into the IGM, raising its temperature to T ≈ 20,000 - 30,000 K. This heating had profound effects on the IGM's equation of state and the Lyman-α forest observations.</p>

            <p>The detailed ionization state of the IGM during reionization involves non-equilibrium processes. The evolution of species fractions (HI, HII, HeI, HeII, HeIII) is governed by a set of coupled differential equations involving photoionization, collisional ionization, and recombination processes.</p>

            <h3>5.2 Radiative Transfer in Reionization</h3>
            <p>Accurate modeling of reionization requires solving the radiative transfer equation in complex 3D geometries. Various numerical methods have been developed, including ray-tracing algorithms, moment methods (e.g., M1 closure), and Monte Carlo techniques. These methods account for effects such as shadowing, spectral hardening, and source clustering.</p>

            <h3>5.3 21cm Cosmology</h3>
            <p>The 21cm hyperfine transition of neutral hydrogen provides a powerful probe of the reionization epoch. The spin temperature of this transition is influenced by coupling to the CMB temperature, collisions, and the Wouthuysen-Field effect. The resulting 21cm brightness temperature relative to the CMB serves as a sensitive measure of the neutral fraction during reionization.</p>

First observed by <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1977ApJ...214..679B/abstract" target=None>Jack Baldwin</a> in 1977, this effect provides critical insights into the physical processes occurring in the vicinity of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at galactic centers. The relationship manifests as a decrease in emission line strength relative to the continuum as the overall luminosity of the AGN increases.</p>

<h2>Physical Mechanisms</h2>

<h3>Photoionization Dynamics</h3>

Photoionization models form the primary framework for understanding the Baldwin effect. These models quantify the interactions between ionizing radiation from the central engine and gas in the broad-line region (BLR). As the luminosity of the central source increases, it alters the ionization state of the BLR gas, leading to a non-linear response in emission line strengths.

The ionization parameter, which quantifies the ratio of ionizing photon density to hydrogen density, is crucial to this process. As luminosity increases, this parameter evolves, causing specific changes in the BLR's ionization structure. The relationship between the ionization parameter, luminosity, and gas density depends on several factors:

<ul>
    <li>Spectral shape of the ionizing continuum</li>
    <li>Density distribution of the BLR gas</li>
    <li>Elemental abundances in the BLR</li>
    <li>Optical depth of the BLR gas to ionizing radiation</li>
</ul>


<p>These factors contribute to the observed inverse relationship characteristic of the Baldwin effect. As continuum luminosity increases, the higher ionization state of the gas can reduce the efficiency of certain emission line production mechanisms, particularly for lines sensitive to the gas ionization state, such as C IV λ1549.</p>




<h3>Radiation Pressure and Gas Dynamics</h3>

<p>Radiation pressure significantly influences the BLR structure and contributes to the Baldwin effect. Increased AGN luminosity results in greater radiation pressure on the BLR gas. This enhanced pressure can alter gas distribution and dynamics, potentially pushing line-emitting gas to greater distances or modifying its density distribution. These changes directly affect emission line strengths and contribute to the observed Baldwin effect.</p>

<h3>Relativistic Effects and Viewing Angle Dependencies</h3>

<p>Relativistic effects, particularly beaming in sources with relativistic jets (e.g., blazars), impact the observed Baldwin effect. Relativistic beaming can cause an apparent increase in observed continuum luminosity without a corresponding increase in emission line strength, as the line-emitting regions are not subject to the same beaming effects. The magnitude of beaming depends on the bulk Lorentz factor of the jet and the viewing angle, introducing a geometric component to the Baldwin effect.</p>

<h3>Accretion Disk Physics</h3>

<p>Massive accretion disks around SMBHs fundamentally influence the Baldwin effect. The accretion disk serves as the primary ionizing radiation source and shapes the AGN's spectral energy distribution (SED). As accretion rate and luminosity increase, the disk's temperature profile evolves, altering the ionizing continuum shape. This SED change leads to variations in the BLR gas ionization state and, consequently, emission line strengths.

Higher luminosity AGNs tend to exhibit softer ionizing continua due to the shifting peak of the accretion disk spectrum. This softening can result in a decrease in the proportion of high-energy photons relative to low-energy photons, affecting the ionization balance in the BLR and contributing to the observed Baldwin effect.</p>

<h2>Associated Phenomena and Broader Implications</h2>

<h3>Eigenvector 1 (EV1) Correlations</h3>

<p>The Baldwin effect is connected to the Eigenvector 1 (EV1) correlations, which describe a set of correlated properties in AGN spectra. These properties include the width of the Hβ line, the strength of Fe II emission relative to Hβ, and the soft X-ray photon index. The Baldwin effect's inclusion in this correlated set of observables suggests a fundamental link between the physical processes driving these spectral features.

The connection between the Baldwin effect and EV1 implies that the underlying physics is tied to fundamental AGN parameters such as black hole mass, accretion rate, and potentially the system's orientation relative to the line of sight. This relationship provides a framework for understanding the diversity of AGN properties and the physical conditions in their central regions.</p>

<h3>Metallicity and Chemical Evolution</h3>

<p>The chemical composition of the BLR gas, particularly its metallicity, plays a significant role in shaping the Baldwin effect. Observations indicate that BLR gas metallicity tends to increase with AGN luminosity. This luminosity-metallicity relationship introduces additional complexity to the Baldwin effect.

Higher metallicity gas exhibits more efficient cooling, affecting the BLR's thermal balance. This enhanced cooling efficiency can lead to changes in emission line strengths and ratios. Furthermore, increased metal content alters gas opacity, affecting radiative transfer processes and potentially contributing to the observed luminosity dependence of emission line strengths.</p>

<h3>Variability and Time-Dependent Effects</h3>

<p>AGN continuum emission variability introduces time-dependent aspects to the Baldwin effect. BLR gas does not respond instantaneously to changes in the ionizing continuum, resulting in a delay between continuum variations and corresponding changes in emission line strengths. This delay, known as the reverberation lag, can cause temporary decorrelation between continuum luminosity and emission line strength, contributing to the observed scatter in the Baldwin effect relationship.

Long-term variability studies have revealed that individual AGN can exhibit Baldwin effect-like behavior as they vary in luminosity over time. This "intrinsic" Baldwin effect within single objects provides insights into the underlying physics and constrains BLR models. </p>




The Baldwin effect remains a critical area of research in AGN and quasar physics, probing the extreme physical conditions near SMBHs. Future research directions include:

    <li>High-resolution spectroscopic studies to characterize the Baldwin effect across a wide range of AGN types and luminosities.</li>
    <li>Advanced numerical simulations incorporating detailed radiative transfer and gas dynamics to model the BLR under various physical conditions.</li>

This accretion process forms a disk of matter around the black hole, known as the accretion disk. As the matter spirals inward towards the black hole, it loses gravitational potential energy, which is converted into kinetic and thermal energy. This energy conversion process heats up the innermost regions of the disk to extremely high temperatures, causing them to emit X-rays. The X-ray emission from the accretion disk is primarily due to two processes: thermal emission and non-thermal emission. Thermal emission, also known as blackbody radiation, occurs when the hot gas in the inner accretion disk emits X-rays directly. Non-thermal emission, on the other hand, occurs when high-energy particles in the disk collide with photons, boosting their energy up to the X-ray range. This process is known as inverse Compton scattering.</p>

<p>Many AGN exhibit a 'soft excess' at energies less than ~2 keV, which sits above what would be expected from the hard X-ray power-law. This excess emission is often fitted using a black body model, yielding best-fit temperatures in the range of 0.1-0.2 keV. However, the origin of the soft X-ray excess is not well understood and various models have been proposed, including disk reflection, a warm corona, and magnetic reconnection.</p>

<p>Above the accretion disk is a region of even hotter, less dense gas known as the corona. The corona is thought to be responsible for a significant amount of the X-ray emission observed from AGN. The X-rays from the corona can irradiate the accretion disk, causing it to fluoresce and emit its own X-rays. This process is known as Compton reflection or coronal upscattering. In particular, the inverse Compton scattering of photons from the geometrically thin disk by hot electrons in the corona quickly cools the coronal gas. The reflection component in the X-ray spectra of AGN arises from the interaction of the X-ray photons with the accretion disk. This interaction results in the reflection of a fraction of the incident radiation, which forms a characteristic 'echo' in the X-ray light curve. The reflection component is crucial for understanding the geometry and dynamics of the corona and the disk.</p>

<p>The strong gravitational field of the black hole causes the light paths to bend and the X-ray frequencies to shift, leading to effects such as gravitational redshift and time dilation. These relativistic effects can distort the reverberation lags and the reflection spectrum, providing a probe of the black hole's mass and spin. In the context of AGN, 'lags' refer to the time delay between variations in different energy bands of the X-ray emission. At the lowest frequencies, hard lags are observed where the power-law dominated hard band lags the soft band. However, at higher frequencies, soft lags are observed. These lags are interpreted as due to reverberation from the accretion disk, with the reflection component responding to variability from the X-ray corona. The reverberation lags can be measured as a function of frequency using Fourier techniques, revealing the transfer function or impulse response of the system. The lag-frequency and lag-energy spectra can provide information about the geometry and dynamics of the corona and the disc.</p>]]></content><author><name>Vivek Kumar Jha</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The central engine of an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) is a supermassive black hole, which accretes matter from its surroundings.

Understanding pair production is crucial for explaining the observed X-ray and gamma-ray emissions from AGNs, as well as their variability.</p>
<h2>Inner Accretion Disk and Corona Structure</h2>
<p>The inner accretion disk of an AGN consists of a highly ionized plasma where gravitational energy from matter spiraling into the supermassive black hole is converted into heat and radiation. Above the accretion disk lies the hot corona, which plays a key role in high-energy photon production. The corona, composed of relativistic electrons and possibly protons, radiates primarily in the X-ray regime via inverse Compton scattering, where thermal photons from the accretion disk gain energy through interactions with relativistic particles in the corona.</p>
<p>The structure of the corona, along with the accretion disk's properties, directly influences the energy spectrum and intensity of the emitted radiation. The corona’s optical depth, temperature, and magnetic field strength are key factors in determining the efficiency of pair production processes.</p>
<h2>Photon Production and Pair Creation Mechanisms</h2>
<p>The primary mechanisms that produce high-energy photons in AGNs include synchrotron radiation, bremsstrahlung, and inverse Compton scattering. Synchrotron radiation, resulting from relativistic electrons spiraling around magnetic field lines, can produce photons across a broad spectrum, from radio waves to gamma rays. Inverse Compton scattering boosts the energy of soft photons (e.g., UV or X-rays) by collisions with relativistic electrons in the corona.</p>
<p>When these high-energy photons, especially gamma rays, interact with the strong electromagnetic fields near nuclei, Bethe-Heitler pair production can occur, where a photon produces an electron-positron pair in the presence of a proton. This reaction is favored in environments with dense radiation fields and significant proton populations, as seen in the vicinity of AGNs.</p>
<h2>Threshold Energy and Cross-Section for Pair Production</h2>
<p>For pair production to be energetically possible, the energy of the incoming photon must exceed twice the rest mass energy of the electron (1.022 MeV). The cross-section for this process depends on both the photon energy and the interaction angle with the proton. At higher photon energies, the probability of pair production increases, while the proton's mass allows for conservation of both momentum and energy.</p>
<p>The energy of the photon must not only surpass this threshold but also account for the kinetic energy of the produced electron-positron pair. The presence of a proton in the interaction serves to absorb excess momentum, ensuring that the momentum conservation laws are satisfied without violating angular momentum constraints.</p>
<h2>Angular Momentum and Symmetry Considerations</h2>
<p>Conservation of angular momentum is critical in pair production processes. In a simplistic case of photon-photon collisions, the lack of a massive particle to absorb angular momentum would violate these conservation laws. Hence, the involvement of a proton or nucleus provides the necessary degree of freedom to ensure total angular momentum conservation. The proton's large mass enables it to absorb the recoil momentum without gaining significant kinetic energy, allowing the system to satisfy both linear and angular momentum conservation.</p>
<h2>Cascade Processes and Runaway Pair Production</h2>
<p>Once an initial electron-positron pair is produced, secondary interactions with the ambient radiation field can result in a cascade process. High-energy pairs can further interact with photons to create additional pairs, leading to an exponential growth in the number of particles. This cascade is particularly effective in regions with high photon densities and strong magnetic fields, such as those found in AGNs. As the electron-positron pairs spiral along magnetic field lines, they emit synchrotron radiation, which further enhances the energy density of the radiation field, fueling continued pair production.</p>
<h2>Magnetic Field Influence and Synchrotron Radiation</h2>
<p>The magnetic field in the corona and surrounding regions of the AGN plays a crucial role in both pair production and the emission of synchrotron radiation. The energy losses due to synchrotron radiation are significant for relativistic particles, particularly electron-positron pairs, as they move along curved magnetic field lines. The synchrotron emission provides a direct observational signature, contributing to the AGN's X-ray and gamma-ray spectra.The strength of the magnetic field determines the synchrotron cooling rate, which, in turn, influences the overall energy budget available for pair production and further interactions. In strong magnetic fields, synchrotron cooling can dominate, leading to rapid energy loss and limiting the number of high-energy pairs.</p>

<h2>Observational Significance and X-ray Flares</h2>
    
<p>The pair production mechanism and subsequent cascade processes are believed to be responsible for the rapid X-ray flares observed in AGNs. The variability of these flares, on timescales ranging from minutes to hours, provides insights into the size of the emission region, typically a few Schwarzschild radii of the black hole. These flares are thought to arise from magnetic reconnection events or shocks within the corona, which rapidly accelerate particles and lead to enhanced pair production. Observationally, the nonthermal component of AGN X-ray spectra can be linked to synchrotron and inverse Compton emission from electron-positron pairs. The study of these emissions, particularly in the hard X-ray and gamma-ray bands, offers a window into the physical conditions near the black hole, such as the corona's temperature, density, and magnetic field structure. </p>

<p>Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.</p>

<p>What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.</p>

<p>A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.</p>

<p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">The Final Frontier</h2>

<p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

<p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

<p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

<p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

<p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
