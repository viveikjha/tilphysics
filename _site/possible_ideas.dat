------- These are the astrophysics topics.
1. The Neutron star mass limit.
2. The movement of plasma in the Sun Earth region.
3. The transmission of any wavelength light through the atmosphere.
5. Early galaxies.
6. Polarization of light (astrophysical 1,2,3 maybe a sequence!)
13. The cosmological constant.
15. The stellar population synthesis modeling.
16. Inhomogeneity in quasar accretion disks.
